 # functions
 First of all you could chat.
 At the welcome page, you could click on the top navigations bar, that would give you some surprises.
 Every user chats with a nickname, if you chose to register in site. If you registered with google, you will chat with your google name.
 At the right top corner, you could enter a chatroom name and choose whether to create or join a chat.
 You can not create an existing chatroom.
 If you would like to enter an exiting chatroom, first, you have to input the correct chatroom name. After that, you would have to ask you friend inside the chatroom to click the password button on the down-left corner, that would generate a ten digit access password that changes everytime the password button is pressed. You have to enter the correct passcode in order to enter the chat room.
